                Duolingo: The Leading Language Learning App for Beginners
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Duolingo is the most popular and widely used language learning app, with over 300
            million active users worldwide. Duo's key trait is a gamified approach to
            everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you start using Duolingo, you choose your knowledge level and start off with a
            sequence of vocabulary learning lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app encourages you to set daily goals for vocabulary practice and tracks your
            progress through interactive exercises, videos, quizzes, and games. You earn rewards
            and
            advance to higher levels as you complete lessons and demonstrate your language
            skills.

        <p>
            However, despite its popularity, Duolingo has its limitations. The app is not
            suitable
            for intermediate or advanced level users (B1-C1), as it cannot offer much beyond
            basic
            vocabulary and grammar practice.

        ELSA Speak is a unique language learning app that specifically focuses on
        pronunciation

        <p>
            However, it is important for students to note that ELSASpeak is not a comprehensive

        </p>
        <p>
            It is solely focused on pronunciation, not english vocabulary, and learners may need

                Busuu: Language Learning from A1 to C1
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Busuu is popular language learning app that offers a comprehensive online English
            language learning experience to users of almost all levels, from beginner to more
            advanced learners.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>key feature</b> of Busuu is that it covers all skillls, that you would need,
            for
            example, to live in English speaking country. The app includes vocabulary exercises,
            grammar, writing, reading, and listening practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the main advantages of Busuu is its flexibility in terms of user knowledge
            levels
            and skills. You can of course start at any level, namely A1 to C1, and the app will
            automatically adjust to your knowledge level.

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            However, the downside of Busuu is that it can become dull and not engaging at higher
            levels. The app feels more like a traditional language course, like you would get at
            the
            British Council, with the only difference being that you don't actually get the fun
            of
            real-world conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, for a well-rounded and comprehensive approach to language learning,
            Busuu
            is a solid choice. Its free courses are our top pick for now, as it suits all the
            different language knowledge levels plus allows you to practice all the aspects of
            learning English together.
        </p>
        <p>
            The premium subscription is relatively cheap here too.

        <p>
            Babbel is a language learning app that is quite similar to Duolingo and Busuu.
            However,
            Babbel sets itself apart by focusing mainly on providing users with everyday
            conversational skills. With this app, you can learn basic, English language phrases,
            and
            13 other languages, including Spanish, French, and German.
        </p>
        <p>
            Babbel offers a range of course-like exercises and free lessons that cover various
            topics and real life situations, like meeting in restaurant, getting to know
            someone,
            etc. Additionally, the app offers real lessons with different tutors, which can give
            you
